# Explore Hyrule #
## Introduction ##
Explore Hyrule is a website created to promote *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* video game for the Nintendo Switch. The website is aimed at displaying the features of the game and to inform users about some of the lore and gameplay they can expect from the product.

The site will serve as a promotional piece to entice potential customers who are interested in the game to purchase the title and provide a path directly from site discovery to purchase.

## Design Choices ##
### Layout ###
The site is designed as a single continuous page, rather than dividing each section up as individual pages, allowing the user to scroll through each section without interuption. This is done as the purpose of the page is to guide users through the content revealing it in order rather than leaving it to the users. The user still has the ability to navigate through the sections or return the the beginning at all times using the navigation buttons.

### Wireframes ###
Following are links to mobile and desktop wireframes used to design the layout of the website. Tablet sizes will retain most of the layout of the desktop version with minor scaling changes to account for screen sizes.

### Colors ###
Colors were chosen to fit in with the game content and its external media such as physical collectors' guides.

Colors were lifted from sample page text and screenshots of actual gameplay to create a palette to inform the aesthetic of the site.

The font style and overall design is also influenced by the gameplay UI and guide book design in order to make the site fit in with already existing branding.
